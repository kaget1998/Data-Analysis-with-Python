🎵 Spotify Songs Exploratory Data Analysis (2015–2025)

🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large Spotify songs dataset containing tracks released between 2015 and 2025. The analysis explores how audio features influence song popularity and how music trends evolve over time, using advanced data visualizations.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze factors affecting song popularity

Identify trends in music characteristics over time

Perform feature engineering on real-world data

Create insightful visualizations using Seaborn

📂 Dataset

Source: Spotify music dataset

Records: 85,000+ songs

Features: Popularity, danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, explicit content, release date, and more

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔧 Key Steps Performed

Data loading and inspection

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Feature engineering (release_year, year_group)

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

Advanced visualizations using Seaborn:

Histogram

JointPlot

Violin Plot

FacetGrid

Correlation Heatmap

📊 Key Insights

Danceability and energy have a positive influence on song popularity

Explicit songs show slightly higher median popularity

Energy and loudness are strongly correlated

Music popularity trends vary significantly across different time periods

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Data Visualization

Debugging & problem-solving (KeyError handling)
